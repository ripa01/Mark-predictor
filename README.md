# ML Mark Predictor

This is a machine learning-based application that predicts student marks based on their study hours. The prediction is calculated using the Linear Regression algorithm. The application is deployed using Flask, a Python web framework.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/ripa01/Mark-predictor.git

2. Change into the project directory:
  **cd Mark-predictor**

3. Install the required dependencies:
   **pip install -r requirements.txt**

4. Start the Flask server:
   **flask run**

5. Open a web browser and go to **'http://localhost:5000'** to access the application.

## Usage

1. On the home page, enter the number of study hours in the input field.

2. Click the "Predict Marks" button to calculate the predicted marks based on the entered study hours.

3. The predicted marks will be displayed on the page.

## Customization

You can customize the application to suit your needs:

- Modify the ML algorithm: If you want to use a different machine learning algorithm for the prediction, you can replace the Linear Regression algorithm with another algorithm of your choice. Update the model training code accordingly.

- Improve the model's accuracy: Depending on your dataset and requirements, you can enhance the model's accuracy by collecting more data, engineering additional features, or tuning hyperparameters.

- Customize the UI: You can modify the HTML templates in the `templates` directory to change the layout, style, and content of the application's web pages.
